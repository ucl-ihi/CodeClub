# Case Study

Patricia 👩 is a 28(-ish) year old PhD student from Australia 🇦🇺.
She is trying to create a function in _R_ to perform a _last observation carried forward_ (LOCF) imputation on CPRD data that takes account of how long ago the last observation was recorded.
She has tried some code she found on the Internet, which works but _"is taking too long"_ so she sent her script to a post-doc in her lab, Dr. Tonie Alexandra 🤓.
Tonie is cool and _R-savvy_, but unfortunately (s)he is unable to reproduce Patricia's output 😢.

The order of where you go depends on your specific case.

After defining the question – have you form / word it 



Google – really short phrase, with the most specific keywords

Person – use terminology you know they are familiar with, e.g. can talk about locf, there are of expertise 

CC GitHub – code-related, think someone in IHI has knowledge of or can benefit from knowing about, slightly more health-specific/application based, or specific tools to IHI e.g. DSH or CALIBERcodelists. More beginner friendly than StackOverflow as it's internal, but StackOverflow has more members and more / wider coding expertise

StackOverflow – for coding/programming related problems, emphasis on the programming/tools (not on hardware, or on health), lots of questions/info on there already, being able to search for the right thing (on Google, which can point you here, or StackOverflow) can take you to lots of relevant questions. Will see lots of different answers/comments and upvotes/accepted answers to see the best/most approved ones. Quite updated, although some questions can be old/feature old tech/packages and some questions don't have answers. In some cases you'll have to post your own question.

GI and SO for code-related problems, however you should use them slightly differently


Similar:

for code-related problems


Different:

CC GitHub Issues more beginner-friendly

more appropriate to mention about domain-specific content e.g. I'm doing GWAS... I'm using data from the UK Biobank   - helpful to know – but in Stack Overflow must describe the problem purely from a programming/tools perspective

CC GitHub Issues, can talk about specific infrastructure as well, e.g. CS Cluster, can talk about hardware e.g. GPU usage – however in the future we'll have separate repos for e.g. DSH so might be more relevant to use their Issues page

Tags and labels – two ways of categorising your problems and making them seen by relevant people



GitHub theory – minimum guide

StackOverflow theory – minimum guide

Differences between them and when to use

## Step 3: .blue2[Asking for Help]

### How to present the question

--

+ Each place of help requires **.red[different phrasing]** and **.red[different amounts of details]**

+ GitHub Issues and Stack Overflow **.red[require]** problems to be presented in a certain way

+ By following the **.red[recommendations]** you are more likely to get help

+ This will make it **.red[easier and quicker]** for others to understand your problem and offer their solutions 

+ Useful and nice for **.red[documenting]** solutions for future use 

<br/>
_NB – forming a good coding question is different to writing a paper or posting on Slack!_

---
### How do I ask a good question on StackOverflow?

+ Search, and research

+ Write a title that summarizes the specific problem

+ Introduce the problem before you post any code

+ Help others reproduce the problem

+ Include all relevant tags

+ Proof-read before posting!

+ Post the question and respond to feedback

+ Look for help asking for help

GitHub theory – minimum guide

StackOverflow theory – minimum guide

Differences between them and when to use



Search and research

Check your question hasn't already been answered – search using different phrases, keep a track of what you searched and what you tried



Choose a clear title

The 'core' / main coding problem - Include language choice, specific library/package, tools

e.g. How do I install pip on Windows?   fatal error: Python.h: No such file or directory

Imagine you're talking to a busy colleague and can only say one sentence



Introduce the problem

Expand on the title. Explain how you found the problem - what did you do, what did you find. Also include - what did you try and what do you want. Be engaging and succinct. Include necessary details, e.g. version of R used



Include a minimal reproduceable example

A code snippet or (working) code example with the bare minimum for others to try 

Don't include real/sensitive data – simplify e.g. the data and variable names, remove unnecessary detail and comments

Include expected and observed outputs, e.g. error message



Add relevant tags

Will appear on the relevant sections of Stack Overflow and helps reach the right audience


Proof-read

Check it makes sense, describes your problem well, and uses correct spelling and grammar


Be ready to reply 

You might need to respond to comments/answers – the sooner you rectify queries/engage, the happier and more engaged your helpers should be

### DOs 👌 and DON'Ts 🙅

+ **.green[DO]** search and research before asking

+ **.green[DO]**  answer your own question!

+ **.green[DO]**  share something cool (on Code Club GitHub), even if it's not a question

+ **.green[DO]**  choose an Accepted Answer (Stack Overflow) or Upvote / Close Issue (Code Club GitHub)

+ **.green[DO]**  engage and be nice

+ **.green[DO]**  proof-read (and edit as needed)

+ **.red[DON'T]** be apologetic

???

It's okay to answer your own question! If you do, reply to your question/Issue with your solution / how you found it / what it does – you will help others

Want to share something cool? Post and answer with what you found

If you've found the one you've been looking for – choose it as your Accepted Answer (Stack Overflow) or Upvote or Close Issue (GitHub Issues) - once it's closed, people can no longer add their comments, so you may want to keep it open for a while or reopen an Issue

Be engaging – reply to comments, write down your findings from others' solutions - be nice, no need to be apologetic

Proof-read - You can always edit your question
